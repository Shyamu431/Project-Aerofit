# Project-Aerofit
Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.

### Business Problem

> In this project, I have tried to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company. I also tried to investigate whether there are any differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

**Product Portfolio:**

- [x] The KP281 is an entry-level treadmill that sells for $1,500.

- [x] The KP481 is for mid-level runners that sell for $1,750.

- [x] The KP781 treadmill is having advanced features that sell for $2,500.

* I have started this project by doing exploratory data analysis with the help of python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

* Detected the Outliers present in the dataset using Boxplot as well as IQR methods.

* In the later part of the section, I tried to find the marginal probabilities and conditional probabilites on the contingency tables of the treadmills

* Utilized graphical libraries to convey compelling insights through various graph representations.

* Presented insights and gave recommendations at the final stage of this project.
